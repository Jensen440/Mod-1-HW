# Coinbase

## Overview and Origin

Coinbase is a company that operates a platform for cryptocurrency exchange.  In addition it is a publically traded USA company.  They are the largest exchange of its kind by the metric of trading volume.
They operate remotely, both with their employees and their lack of a physical headquarters.
Coinbase was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam.
The exchange was founded using $150,000 by use of the startup company Y Combinator.  One major reason for its launch was to buy and sell bitcoins via bank transfers.  Later on they recieved other investments.  First a $5 million Series A invesment from Union Square Ventures in May of 2013, with a later additional $25 million investment in December.  They recieved $75 million from an investment group headed by Draper Jurvetson in January 2015.

## Business Activities

The current primary use for their platform is the buying and selling of various cryptocurrencies via other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies (like the UDS, Euro, CDN, etc.), making them much more accesible to the general population for trading than previous iterations of similar platforms.
A cryptocurrency is a form of virtual currency, which is "a digital reprisentation of value that functions as a medium of exchange".  These cryptocurrencies have some benefits in comparison to other more traditional methods of exchange.  One of these is that the transaction cost is negligable or nothing at all.  There is also no time or quantity restrictions on making a transaction, they open all year, all night and day, as many times as you'd like.  The security of a decentralized blockchain are inherently more secure than traditional transactions as well, as long as the exchange itself is trustworthy.

## Landscape

They are the most utilized (by trading volume) cryptocurrency exchange in the world.  Others operating within this buisness area are Crypto.com, Kraken, Kucoin, and BitMart to name a few.
Until recently these companies were all experiencing incredible growth, and have been effected directly by the bull market hitting the stock and cryptocurrency trading scenes.
Coinbase had been growing quickly as well, even having what is considered one of the most effective superbowl comercials of all time.  However, as recently as 2022 they had to lay off 18% of their workforce due to the reduction in prices for cryptocurrencies and associated platforms and services.

## Results

The growth of Coinbase and some cryptocurrencies are similar in trajectory.  Such as when Coinbase went from $190M in Q1 revanue in 2020 to $1.8B in 2021.  They also grew to a point that Coinbase became a publically traded company on Nasdaq via a direct stock listing.  Even growing in price from $250-$328.28 on the day of listing.  All things considered they have not been surviving the cryptocurrency crash of the last 2-3 months well.  Bitcoin had dropped from $47,454 to $18,948, roughly a 60% decrease in price.  However, Coinbase has gone from $204 to $53 during the same period (roughly 74% decrease), and has been relatively stagnent in price since then.

## Recomendations

My personal recomdations are as follows.  Continue to expand within other closely associated cryptocurrency ventures such as NFTs, DeFi projects, and DeFi games.  They might also want to begin to look into possible physical locations to base their operations out of, so that they may more closely manage and interact with their projects as well as promote marketing.  They have already shown that they can take advantage of their marketing prowess, it might be beneficial to be able to have this as a tool to use for other promotions, visits, and other things they cannot do in a remote fashion.
